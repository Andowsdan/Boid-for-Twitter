# Android Billing Library
=============

For Boid to compile correctly in Eclipse, you will have to clone the android-billing-library (also on my profile) and import into Eclipse as an Android Library Project. From there, you can reference the Android Library in Boid's project in the project's Android properties.

You can find it here: https://github.com/afollestad/android-billing-library
