Android Billing Library
=============

For Boid to compile correctly in Eclipse, you will have to clone the android-billing-library (also on my profile) and import into Eclipse as an Android Library Project. From there, you can reference the Android Library in Boid's project in the project's Android properties.

You can find it here: https://github.com/afollestad/android-billing-library

Licensing
=============
You are permitted to clone the code, modify, and play around with it for personal use. If you do something that you think would be good for the app, feel free to make a pull request; if we like it, it'll be included in the next Google Play Store update.

Redistribution of the app (APK) is not permitted, unless you give credit to Team Boid (Aidan Follestad, Joe Simpson, Philip Oakley, and Graham Macphee).
